> **Disclaimer**: As I wrote this lecture, the scope gradually
  increased because there was always the next thing I wanted
  to include. And it was kind of hard to stop.
  The exercises today will very unrestrictive, so that you can
  explore in your own tempo and so that we have more time
  for questions on Friday.

## Some Preparation


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

Today, we will explore the process of modeling
and look at different types of models.
In part, we will do so using the **tidymodels** framework.
The tidymodels framework extends the tidyverse
with specialized tools for all kinds of modeling tasks
that fit neatly in with all the tools
we already know. Go ahead and install them with:


```r
install.packages("tidymodels")
```

### Sidenote on Reproducible Environments with `renv`

At this point, we have installed quite a lot of packages.
On one hand, this is great fun because the extend what we
can do and make tedious tasks fun.
On the other hand, every package that we add introduces
what is called a dependency.
If a user doesn't have the package installed,
our analysis will not run.
If we are feeling experimental and use functions
from packages that are under active development and might
change in the future, we will run into trouble
when we update the package.
But never updating anything ever again is no fun!
I will show you, how to get the best of both worlds:
All the packages and functions that your heart desires
while maintaining complete reproducibility. 
This is to make sure that you can come back to your old
projects 2 years from now and they still just run
as they did at the time.

<aside>
<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/">
<img src="images/renv.svg">
</a>
</aside>

This solution is a package called `renv`.
The idea is as follows:
Instead of installing all your packages
into one place, where you can only have one version
of a package at a time, `renv` installs packages
locally **in your project** folder.
It also meticulously writes down the version numbers
of all the packages you installed and keeps a cache,
so it will not copy the same version twice.

It is an R package like any other, so first,
we install it with:


```r
install.packages("renv")
```

Then, in our RStudio project in the R console,
we initialize the project to use `renv` with:


```r
renv::init()
```

This does a couple of things.
It creates a file named `.Rprofile`, in which it
writes `source("renv/activate.R")`.
The R-profile file is run automatically every
time you start a R session in this folder,
so it makes sure `renv` is active every time
you open the project.
It also creates a folder called `renv`.
This is the where it will install packages
you want to use in the project.
The most important file is the `renv.lock` file.
You can have a look at it, it is just a text file
with all the packages and their exact versions.

You notice, that after initializing renv,
we have no packages, so for example we
can't load the tidyverse as usual.
We will have to install it again!
However, in this case it should be fairly
fast, because renv knows that it was 
already installed globally so
it simply copies the files,
which is fast.
After having installed a new package,
we call:


```r
renv::snapshot()
```

Renv tells us, what we changed in our environment
and after we confirm, it notes down the changes.

Not it is also really easy to collaborate with
other people. Because after we send them
our project folder, all they have to do is run:


```r
renv::restore()
```

To install all packages noted down in the lockfile.
We can also use this ourselves if we installed
a few to many packages or did an update we
regret and want to go back
to what is written in the lockfile.

Finally, renv also provides functions to update
or install new packages. They work like `install.packages`,
but a bit more versatile.
For example, let me show you the different
locations from which we can install packages.

1. The main location is [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
  (The Comprehensive R Archive Network).
  This is also from where you installed R itself.
  R packages on there are subject to certain standards
  and usually stable and tested.
2. We can also install packages directly from the source
  code other people uploaded.
  [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform where
  you can upload code and track changes to it.
  A lot of times, you can find the current developement
  version of an R package, or packages that are not
  yet on CRAN on GitHub.

`renv` can install packages from GitHub as well,
for example let us say, we want to test out the
latest version of the `purrr` package to give feedback
to the developers.

<https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr> here it says:


```r
# ...
# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/purrr")
```

Well, we don't need devtools for this, because `renv` can
do this with the regular install function:


```r
renv::install("tidyverse/purrr")
```

Giving  it just a package name installs a package from CRAN,
a pattern of `"username/packgename"` installs from GitHub.
Now, back to the actual topic of today!

After having initialized `renv` we need to install
the packages that we need for the project even
if we already have them in our global package cache,
just so that `renv` knows about them.

## All models are wrong, but some are useful

Such goes the quote but statistician George Box.

> »All models are wrong, but some are useful«
> — George Box

What this means is that any model is but a simplification
of reality and must always omit details.
No model can depict the complete underlying
reality. However, models are useful, and to
understand what they are useful for, we must first look at
the different types of models out there.

### Types of Models

The [tidymodels book](https://www.tmwr.org/software-modeling.html#types-of-models)
names three types of models,
where any particular model can fall into multiple
categories at once:

<aside>
<a href="https://www.tidymodels.org/">
<img src="images/tidymodels.svg">
</a>
</aside>

1. **Descriptive Models**\ 
  are purely used to describe the underlying
  data to make patters easier to see.
  When we add a smooth line to a ggplot
  with `geom_smooth`, the default
  method is a so called LOESS curve, which
  stands for Locally Estimated Scatterplot
  Smoothing. It does produce insights 
  by revealing patterns to us,
  but by itself can not be used 
  e.g. to make predictions. It is
  just a pretty looking smooth line.
  
<aside>

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-155-1.png" width="100%" />

</aside>

2. **Inferential Models**\ 
  are designed to test hypothesis or
  make decisions. They rely heavily on
  our assumptions about the data
  (e.g. what probability distribution
  the populations follows) and will
  be most likely encountered by you
  to answer research questions.
  They are the models that typically
  produce a p-value, which you compare
  to a threshold like we did last week

3. **Predictive Models**\ 
  are designed to process the data we
  have and make predictions about
  some response variable upon receiving
  new data. When done correctly,
  we also hold out on some of the data
  that our model never gets to see,
  until it is time to evaluate and
  test how it performs on unseen data.
  Depending on how much we know
  (or want to know) about the
  underlying processes, we differentiate
  between **mechanistic** models like
  fitting a physically meaningful
  function to data and **empirically driven** models, which are mainly
  concerned with creating good
  predictions, no matter the underlying
  mechanism.

We will now explore different examples.
First, let me introduce our dataset for today:

## Say Hello to Spotify Data

I created a playlist on spotify,
which is quite diverse so that we can
look at a range of features. You can
even listen to it [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Ljg7QjvftQ7qNbGiM2Qzd?si=_DqZqE1xTmKoFqp898cftA) while you do the
exercises if you want. I am doing so, as I write
this. The cool thing about spotify is,
that they have an API, an Application Interface. APIs are ways for
computer programs to talk to each other.
So while we use the spotify app to look up songs, computers
use the API to talk to the spotify server.
And because R has a rich ecosystem of packages,
someone already wrote a package that allows R to talk to
this API: [`spotifyr`](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/index.html).

If you check out the R folder in this lecture,
you can see how I downloaded and processed that data about
the playlist. Note that the script will not work for you
right away, because you first need to register
with spotify as a developer and then get a so called token,
like a username and password in one long text, to be allowed
to send bots their way.
You probably just want to download the data from
my github repository [the usual way](https://jmbuhr.de/dataIntro20/lectures/lecture2/#reading-data-with-readr).

Let's have a look, shall we?


```r
library(tidyverse)
```


```r
songs <- read_csv("data/06/spotify_playlist.csv")
```

We can get a quick overview of all columns with:


```r
glimpse(songs, width = 60)
```

```
## Rows: 347
## Columns: 17
## $ track_name        <chr> "Africa", "Take on Me", "Wake Me…

## $ track_year        <dbl> 1982, 1985, 1984, 1983, 2020, 20…
```

Finally some decent numbers!
Not just these measly discrete values
we had last week.
For each song in the playlist, we get the artist,
the year it arrived and a number of features like
how danceable, how loud or fast the song is.
You can easily imagine spotify using these
numbers to suggest new songs based on the features
of those that you have listened to.
And in fact, we are going to lay the foundations
for such an algorithm today.

## Visualising Continuous Distributions

When dealing with a continuous distribution,
like we have for a lot of our features in the spotify
songs dataset, there are always multiple
ways to represent the same data. 
First, we just look at the numbers. We will
use the `valence` values for our songs:


```r
head(songs$valence)
```

```
## [1] 0.732 0.876 0.897 0.772 0.668 0.324
```

Notice anything interesting in the numbers?
I don't either. Our brain is way better suited
for looking at graphical representations,
so: *To the ggplot cave*!


```r
songs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(0), valence)) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-160-1.png" width="100%" />

This is kind of hard to see, because points overlap.
We can get a better picture of the distribution
by using transparency or a bit of jitter:


```r
songs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(0), valence)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.05)
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-161-1.png" width="100%" />

Using a histogram, we can put the points into bins
and get a plot similar to what we got for discrete values.
Note that the plot is flipped on it's side now.


```r
songs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(valence)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-162-1.png" width="100%" />

And we might want to play around with the bin size to
get a better feel for the distribution.
Another way is to apply a smoothing function
and estimate the density of points along a continuous
range, even in places where we originally had no points:


```r
songs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(valence)) +
  geom_density(fill = "darkblue", alpha = 0.3)
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-163-1.png" width="100%" />

Both of these plots can be misleading, if the original
number of points is quite small, and in most cases,
we are better off, showing the actual individual
points as well. This is the reason, why the first plots
I did where vertical, because there is a cool way
of showing both the points and the distribution,
while still having space to show multiple
distributions next to each other.
Imagine taking the density plot, turning it 90 degrees
and then mirroring through the middle.
What we get is a so called **violin plot**.
To overlay the points on top, we will use something
a little more predictable than `jitter` this time:
From the `ggbeeswarm` package I present: `geom_quasirandom`.


```r
songs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(factor(0), valence)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "darkblue", alpha = 0.3) +
  ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom(alpha = 0.6)
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-164-1.png" width="100%" />

This is cool, because now we can easily
compare two different distributions
next to each other and still see all the individual
points.
For example, we might ask:

"Do songs in major cord have a higher valence than
songs in minor cord in our dataset?"


```r
songs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(factor(mode), valence)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "darkblue", alpha = 0.3) +
  ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "Mode (Minor/Major)")
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-165-1.png" width="100%" />

> **Note**: This jittering only works, because the
  feature on the x-axis is discrete. If it where continuous,
  we would be changing the data by jittering on the x-axis.

We might also want to add summaries like the mean for each
group to the plot with an additional marker.
This leads us to the general concept of **summary statistics**.
There is a number of them, and they can be quite useful
to, well, summarise a complex distribution.
But they can also be very misleading, as can any simplification be.

### Summary Statistics...

Let us start by considering different things we
can say about our distribution in one number.
First, we might look at the range of our numbers,
the maximum and minimum.
We will do this per mode, so we can compare the values.


```r
songs %>% 
  group_by(mode) %>% 
  summarise(
    max = max(valence),
    min = min(valence)
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 3
##    mode   max    min
##   <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>
## 1     0 0.877 0.0271
## 2     1 0.965 0.0176
```

It appears the valence can assume values between 0 and 1.
A shortcut for this is the `range` function:


```r
range(songs$valence)
```

```
## [1] 0.0176 0.9650
```

Next, we want to know the centers of the points.
There are different notions of being at the center
of the distribution.
The **mean** or *average* is the sum of all values 
divided by the number of values.
The **median** is what we call a quantile, a point that
divides a distribution in equally sized parts,
specifically such that 50% values are below and 50%
are above the median.


```r
songs %>% 
  group_by(mode) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean(valence),
    median(valence)
  )
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 3
##    mode `mean(valence)` `median(valence)`
##   <dbl>           <dbl>             <dbl>
## 1     0           0.399             0.395
## 2     1           0.299             0.258
```

The median is just one of the many percentiles
we can think of. If we display the 50th as
well as the 25th and 75th percentile on one plot,
we get what is called a boxplot:


```r
songs %>% 
  add_row(mode = 1, valence = 1.2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(factor(mode), valence)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "darkblue",
               alpha = 0.3,
               outlier.alpha = 1) +
  annotate(geom = "curve", x = 1.8, y = 1.25, xend = 1.95, yend = 1.19,
           curvature = .3, arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, "mm"))) +
  annotate("text", x = 1.75, y = 1.25,
           label = "outlier\n (that I added because there where none)",
           vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off")
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/box-plot-outlier-1.png" width="100%" />

The "whiskers" of the box extend to 1.5 times the box size or to the
last data point, whichever makes smaller whiskers.
Points that are more extreme than the whiskers are
labeled outliers by the boxplot and usually displayed as
their own points. Like with the violin plot,
we also have the option to plot the original un-summarized
points on top. In this case, we need to make sure
to change the outlier color for the boxplot to
`NA`, because otherwise we are plotting them twice:


```r
songs %>% 
  add_row(mode = 1, valence = 1.2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(factor(mode), valence)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "darkblue", alpha = 0.3,
               outlier.color =  NA) +
  ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom(alpha = 0.6)
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-169-1.png" width="100%" />

This hints at one downside of boxplots:
The box is a very prominent focus point
of the plot, but by definition,
it only contains 50% of all datapoints.
The rest is delegated to thin whiskers.

Finally, we want to know, how far the values
scatter around their means and the potential
population mean. This is encompassed
in two closely related measures: the **variance**
and the **standard deviation**.

For illustrative purposes, we can plot all datapoints
for e.g the valence in the order in which they appear in the data
and add a line for the mean.


```r
songs %>%
  mutate(index = 1:n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(index, valence)) +
  geom_segment(aes(y = mean(songs$valence),
                   yend = mean(songs$valence),
                   x = 0,
                   xend = length(songs$valence))) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = index, yend = mean(songs$valence)),
               color = "darkred", alpha = 0.6) +
  annotate("text", x = length(songs$valence) + 13, y = mean(songs$valence),
           label = "Mean") +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/valence-mean-1.png" width="100%" />

> The variance is the expected value of the squared deviation
  of a random variable from its mean.

In other words: Take the distance of all points
to the mean and sum them (add all red lines in the plot
above together) and then divide by $n-1$.

$$var(X) = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n}{(x_i-\bar x)^2}}{(n-1)}$$

"Hang on!", I hear you saying: "Why $n-1$?".
And it is an excellent question. The first
statement talked about an expected value.
(One example of an expected value is the mean,
which is the expected value of... well, the values).
And indeed, and expected value often has
the term $1/n$. But the statement was talking
about the expected value (of the squared deviation)
for **the whole population**.
We can only use the uncorrected version when we
have the whole population (e.g. all songs that ever existed)
and want to talk about that population.
But usually, all we have is a **sample**, from
which we want to draw conclusions about the population.
But when we are using the sample to estimate
the variance of the population, it will be biased.
We can correct for this bias by using $n-1$ instead
of $n$.
This is known as Bessel's correction.
I am yet to come by a really intuitive explanation,
but here is one idea: The thing we are dividing
by is not necessarily the sample size any time
we want to try to calculate the expected
value of an estimator, it just happens to be the
sample size in a bunch of cases.
What the term really represents here is the
**degrees of freedom** (DF) of the deviations.
DFs can be thought of as the number of independent things.
The degrees of freedom are $n$ reduced by $1$, because
if we know the mean of a sample (we use it in our
calculation), once we know all but $1$
of the individual values, the last value is automatically
known and thus doesn't count towards the degrees of freedom.

Next up: The **Standard Deviation** (SD) is the square root
of the variance. Which is more commonly used on error
bars, because the square root inverts the squaring that
was done to get the variance. So we are back
in the dimensions of the data.

$$\sigma_X=\sqrt{var(X)}$$

Finally, we have the **Standard Error of the Mean**,
sometimes only called Standard Error (SEM, SE).
It is also used very commonly in error bars.
The reason for a lot of people to favor it over
the SD might just be, that it is smaller,
but they have distinct use-cases.

$$SEM=\sigma / \sqrt{n}$$

We take the standard deviation and divide it
by the square-root of $n$. Imagine this:
We actually have the whole population available.
Like for example all penguins on earth.
And then we repeatedly take samples of
size $n$. The means of these individual samples
will vary, so it will have it's own mean,
standard deviation and variance. The
standard error is the standard deviation of these means.
So it is a measure of how far the means of repeated samples
scatter around the true population mean.
However, we don't usually have the whole population!
Measuring some property of all penguins in the
world takes a long time, and running
an experiment in the lab for all cells that exist
and will ever exist takes an infinite amount of
time. This is probably more than our research grant
money can finance.
So, instead, the Standard Error of the Mean
used the standard deviation of our sample in
the formula above. It is our best estimate
for the standard deviation of the whole population.
So, when you are trying so make inferences
about the mean of the whole population based on your sample,
it makes sense to also give the SEM as a way of
quantifying the uncertainty.

While R has functions for `sd`, `mean` and `var`,
there is not built in function for the `sem`,
but we can easily write one ourselves:


```r
sem <- function(x) sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))
```

### ... or: How to Lie with Graphs

However, be very wary of simple bar graphs with error bars;
there is a lot that can be misleading about them.


```r
songs %>% 
  group_by(mode) %>%
  summarise(across(speechiness, list(m = mean, sd = sd, sem = sem))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(factor(mode), speechiness_m, fill = factor(mode))) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = speechiness_m - speechiness_sem,
                    ymax = speechiness_m + speechiness_sem,
                    color = factor(mode)),
                size = 1.3, width = 0.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_col(size = 1.3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0.06, 0.08)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#1f6293", "#323232")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#1f6293", "#323232")) +
  labs(title = "Don't Do This at Home!",
       y = "Speechiness",
       x = "Mode (Minor / Major)") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 44, family = "Daubmark",
                              color = "darkred")
  )
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/horrible-plot-1.png" width="100%" />

When people say "The y-axis has to include 0",
this is the reason for it. It is no always true,
when there is another sensible baseline that is not 0,
but especially for barplots not having the y-axis start
at 0 is about the most misleading thing you can do.
The main reason for this is that humans perceive
the height of the bars via their area,
and this is no longer proportional when the bars
don't start at 0.
This plot also makes no indication of the type of
error-bars used or the sample size in each group.
It uses the `speechiness` feature, but it hides the
actual distribution behind just 2 numbers
(mean and SEM) per group:


```r
songs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(speechiness, color = factor(mode),
             fill = factor(mode))) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) 
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-171-1.png" width="100%" />

So the next time you see a barplot ask the question:

I hope you can take some inspiration from
this chapter and now have the vocabulary to
know where to look when it comes to your own data.

## Graphic Devices, Fonts and the ggplot Book

I had a lot of fun making the graphs for today's session.
Naturally, there will be a couple of questions
as to how they where done. There is two pointers
I want to give you.

### ggplot book

Firstly, for all things `ggplot`, the third edition
of the **ggplot book** is currently being worked on
by three absolute legends of their craft
[@WelcomeGgplot2; @wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016].
[Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) is the author of the original ggplot and
ggplot2 package, [Danielle Navaro](https://djnavarro.net/)
makes amazing artwork
with and teaches ggplot and
[Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://www.data-imaginist.com/about)
is the current maintainer of ggplot2 and constantly
makes cool features for it.
The under-development book is already available online
for free: <https://ggplot2-book.org/>.

### Graphics Devics

Secondly, we need to briefly talk about a concept
we have only brushed by: **graphics devices** are
to R what your printer is to your computer.
When we create a plot in R, it starts out as mere numbers,
but something has to turn these numbers into
pixels (in the case of raster-images) or vectors
(in the case of vector images; you might know svg or pdf files.
Sorry, but these are not the vectors in R but rather
descriptions of lines).
This is the job ob the graphics device.
When we use the `ggsave` function for example,
it figures out what to use based on the file extension,
but we can also specify it manually.
I am mentioning this here, because
in the plot I just showed you, I used a different font
than the default. This is something that can be
incredibly tricky for graphics devices,
because fonts are handled differently on every operating
system. Luckily, it is about to get way easier,
because Thomas Lin Pedersen is working on another
package, a graphics device, that is both really
fast and works well with fonts.
You can check the current development version here:
<https://ragg.r-lib.org/>

## The Normal Distribution and the Central Limit Theorem

There are many different distributions out there.
Luckily, one of them is quite special and can
be used in a multitude of settings.
It is the harmlessly named **Normal Distribution**.
R has the usual functions for it (density,
probability, quantile, random).


```r
tibble(x = seq(-3, 3, 0.01)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  geom_function(fun = dnorm) +
  stat_function(geom = "area", fun = dnorm,
              fill = "darkblue", alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(y = "density", title = "Normal Distribution Density")

tibble(x = seq(-3, 3, 0.01)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  geom_function(fun = pnorm) +
  labs(y = "probability", title = "Cummulative Probability")
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-172-1.png" width="50%" /><img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-172-2.png" width="50%" />

Now, why is is distribution so special?

> The **Central Limit Theorem** (CLT) states that the
  sample mean of a sufficiently large number
  of independent random variables is approximately
  normally distributed.
  The larger the sample, the better the approximation.

For a great visualization of the central limit
theorem, check out this interactive tutorial by
[Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/probability-distributions/index.html#section3).

Because a lot of values we measure are actually the
sum of many random processes, distributions of things
we measure can often be approximated with a normal distribution.

We can visually test if some values follow the normal
distribution by using a quantile-quantile plot,
which plots the quantiles of our sample against
where the quantiles should be on the normal distribution.
A straight line means it is perfectly normal.


```r
valence <- songs %>% filter(mode == 1) %>% pull(valence)
qqnorm(valence)
qqline(valence)
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-173-1.png" width="100%" />

The values close to the mean are pretty normal,
but the tails of the distribution stray further
from the normal distribution. There are way more
very small and very large values than would
be expected from a normal distribution.

### Log-normality

There is one thing that comes up a lot in biological data:
because a lot of processes in biology are reliant on
signal cascades, they tend to be the result of many
multiplicative effects, rather than additive effects,
as would be required for the Central Limit Theorem.
As a result, they are not distributed normally,
but rather log-normally,
because taking the logarithm of all values
transforms multiplicative effects into additive effects!

## The T-Distribution

The CLT is only valid for **large sample sizes**.
For smaller sample sizes, the distribution of
means has fatter tails than a normal distribution.
This is why for most statistical tests,
we use the **t-distribution** instead of the
normal distribution.
As the degrees of freedom get higher, the
t-distribution approaches the normal distribution.


```r
base <- ggplot() + xlim(-5, 5)

base +
  geom_function(aes(colour = "normal"), fun = dnorm, size = 1.2) +
  geom_function(aes(colour = "t, df = 1"), fun = dt, args = list(df = 1), size = 1.2) +
  geom_function(aes(colour = "t, df = 3"), fun = dt, args = list(df = 3), size = 1.2) +
  geom_function(aes(colour = "t, df = 30"), fun = dt, args = list(df = 30), size = 1.2) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = ""))
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/tdist-1.png" alt="t-distribution in red, normal distribution in black." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:tdist)t-distribution in red, normal distribution in black.</p>
</div>

Remember the valence plot by mode?


```r
songs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(factor(mode), valence)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "darkblue", alpha = 0.3) +
  ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom(alpha = 0.6)
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-174-1.png" width="100%" />

For demonstrative purposes I am going to cheat a little
and pretend that both distributions are approximatley normal
so that we can look at some hypothesis tests:

## Student's T-Test

The first test is called student's t-test. "Student"
was the pseudonym of it's inventor. And the "t" stands
for the t-distribution. We can use it to test
the null hypothesis, that two samples come from the
same (approximately normal) distribution


```r
t.test(valence ~ mode, data = songs)
```

```
## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  valence by mode
## t = 3.9287, df = 328.06, p-value = 0.0001042
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.04999479 0.15027858
## sample estimates:
## mean in group 0 mean in group 1 
##       0.3988897       0.2987530
```

We receive a p-value for the probability to get a difference
in means as extreme or more extreme as observed in our samples.
Here, the p-value is small, not because the difference
is very large, but because we have a lot of values.

Tests, that rely on the assumption of normality
are called **parametric tests**, but when this
assumption can not be met, we need **non-parametric tests**.

## Wilcoxon rank-sum test

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or
Mann–Whitney U test, is one of these.
I get's around the assumption of normality by
transforming the data into **ranks** first.
i.e. all points (independent of group) are
ordered and their values replaced by their
position in the ordering (their rank).
If we think of the t-test as testing for a
difference in means, we can think of the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test as testing for a difference
in medians.

For example, let us test for a difference in
`speechiness` for the two modes (Minor/Major):


```r
wilcox.test(speechiness ~ mode, data = songs)
```

```
## 
##  Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction
## 
## data:  speechiness by mode
## W = 17918, p-value = 0.0003848
## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
```

### Direction of Testing

Both tests have the argument `alternative`,
which can be any of `c("two.sided", "less", "greater")`.
This is the direction of our alternative hypothesis.
Are we testing, for x being greater or less than y?
Or are we testing for a difference in any direction (the default)?
Having a hypothesis about the direction beforehand will
result in smaller p-values (half of the two-sided ones),
but you need to have this hypothesis before looking at
the data, and especially not after running e.g. the
two sided test and then deciding, that you want a
smaller p-value! This is not how p-values work.

If you are unsure about how to tell the functions,
which of two groups is supposed to be greater or lesser,
you can also supply the data as `x` and `y` instead
of using the formula interface as I did above:


```r
speechiness_minor <- songs %>% filter(mode == 0) %>% pull(speechiness)
speechiness_major <- songs %>% filter(mode == 1) %>% pull(speechiness)
wilcox.test(speechiness_minor, speechiness_major)
```

```
## 
##  Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction
## 
## data:  speechiness_minor and speechiness_major
## W = 17918, p-value = 0.0003848
## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
```

If we save the result of the test, we can inspect the object
further and extract information from it:


```r
w_test <- wilcox.test(speechiness_minor, speechiness_major)
w_test$p.value
```

```
## [1] 0.0003848449
```

### Confidence Intervals

The t.test on a lonely sample can also be used to create confidence intervals
around a mean. In short for example a 95% confidence
interval is the range in which we would expect the mean
of a sample to fall in 95% of cases when we repeat
an experiment an infinite amount of times.
These confidence intervals are also sometimes
used as error bars in plots.


```r
valence_minor <- songs %>% filter(mode == 0) %>% pull(valence)
test <- t.test(valence_minor)
test
```

```
## 
##  One Sample t-test
## 
## data:  valence_minor
## t = 21.508, df = 144, p-value < 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.3622315 0.4355478
## sample estimates:
## mean of x 
## 0.3988897
```


```r
test$conf.int
```

```
## [1] 0.3622315 0.4355478
## attr(,"conf.level")
## [1] 0.95
```

Lastly for today, we are going a bit out of scope.
We are leaving the realm of looking at individual
features and try to condense all the information
into as little space as possible.

## Chrunching Dimensions with Dimensionality Reduction: PCA

The general notion of Dimensionality Reduction is to
take all the features that we have and construct new
features from them, so that we can represent our data
with fewer features while loosing little information.

For example, when two features are highly correlated
i.e. one changes when the other does,
we might be better off replacing them with a single
new feature, that goes along
the axis of maximum variance between the two.
A number along this line accounts for most of the
variance in these points, and the rest can
be accounted for by a number describing the distance
to that line (a perpendicular axis), which
is less important than the first axis we found.


```r
songs %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = energy,
             y = loudness,
             label = track_name)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-181-1.png" width="100%" />

Imagine you are whale shark

![[@ArtworkAllisonHorst]](images/whaleshark.png){.external}

And want to orient your mouth in such a way
that you can eat the greatest amount of krill
in one sweep

![[@ArtworkAllisonHorst]](images/krill.png){.external}

This is your first principal component. The
second is perpendicular to the first.
This is a throwback to "Math for Natural Scientists" and liner
algebra, we are defining a new coordinate system here.

But whale sharks swim in 3 dimensions, not 2,
and our data has even more dimensions, with one features
being represented as one dimension.

> It can be quite hard for humans to imaging being an
  N-dimensional whale shark.

But R and tidymodels has us covered:


```r
library(tidymodels)
```

PCA is not a model in itself, but rather a data preprocessing
step that generates new features (the principal components),
which we can later use for other models.
But today, we will do just the preprocessing by itself.

In tidymodels, preprocessing is done by defining a
**recipe**:


```r
songs_rec <- recipe( ~ ., data = songs) %>% 
  update_role(track_name, track_artists, new_role = "id") %>% 
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_pca(all_predictors())
```

We then take the recipe and **prepare** it.


```r
songs_prep <- prep(songs_rec)
songs_prep
```

```
## Data Recipe
## 
## Inputs:
## 
##       role #variables
##         id          2
##  predictor         15
## 
## Training data contained 347 data points and no missing data.
## 
## Operations:
## 
## Centering and scaling for danceability, energy, key, loudness, ... [trained]
## PCA extraction with danceability, energy, key, loudness, ... [trained]
```

From this prepared recipe, we extract a tidy form
of the step we care about (usually the last one)
to see, what happened to our data.


```r
songs_compontents <- tidy(songs_prep, 2)
songs_compontents
```

```
## # A tibble: 225 × 4
##    terms              value component id       
##    <chr>              <dbl> <chr>     <chr>    
##  1 danceability     -0.300  PC1       pca_hXKms
##  2 energy           -0.376  PC1       pca_hXKms
##  3 key              -0.0498 PC1       pca_hXKms
##  4 loudness         -0.373  PC1       pca_hXKms
##  5 mode              0.153  PC1       pca_hXKms
##  6 speechiness      -0.146  PC1       pca_hXKms
##  7 acousticness      0.364  PC1       pca_hXKms
##  8 instrumentalness  0.359  PC1       pca_hXKms
##  9 liveness         -0.123  PC1       pca_hXKms
## 10 valence          -0.318  PC1       pca_hXKms
## # … with 215 more rows
```

The original features where replace by **Principal Components**
that explain most of the variance.
We can see, which features ended up contributing
to which components:


```r
songs_compontents %>% 
  mutate(terms = tidytext::reorder_within(terms, by = value, within = component)) %>% 
  filter(component %in% paste0("PC", 1:3)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value, terms, fill = value > 0)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ component, scales = "free") +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_colorblind() +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  tidytext::scale_y_reordered()
```

<img src="dataintro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-186-1.png" width="100%" />

We had to use 2 little helper functions from the
`tidytext` package to properly order the bar.
The first component is largely comprised of a high
acousticness and instrumentalness and less energy in the positive direction.
So we expect e.g. classical music to be very high on that axis.
A high value on the second component means a high danceability
while being low in tempo.

We can now explore, how the data looks like in these
new dimensions. We do so, by **baking** the
prepared recipe. We set `new_data` to `NULL`,
because we want to use the data that was already
used to prepare the recipe (i.e. calculate the
principal components).


```r
songs_baked <- bake(songs_prep, new_data = NULL)
songs_baked %>% rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

As always, this only becomes clear with a plot:


```r
plt <- songs_baked %>% 
  mutate(song = paste(track_name, ",", track_artists)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2, label = song)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_point()

plotly::ggplotly(plt)

You can now imagine, using this simpler representation of the
songs in principal component space, to for example
propose new songs to users based on songs that are close to
songs they listened to in this representation.

Lastly, I want to stress, that the principal components are
not created equal. The first component is always the
most important.
Here, we see, that almost 40% of the variance can be explained
just by the first component, so exploring
more than 2 really makes little sense here.


```r
sdev <- songs_prep$steps[[2]]$res$sdev
percent_variation <- sdev^2 / sum(sdev^2)

tibble(component = unique(songs_compontents$component),
       percent_var = percent_variation) %>%
  mutate(component = fct_inorder(component)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(component, percent_var)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Percent variance explained by each PCA component")
```

## Exercises

The **tidytuesday** project also had a spotify
dataset. This one es even more interesting,
because it ranges across different playlists
of various genres and is annotated with said genres.
And it has more data (Over 30000 songs)!
**Download** it here:

<https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md>

## The Plotty Horror Picture Show

Sometimes we have to experience true horror
to see the light in the darkness. Take the spotify data
and make a plot that is truly horrible!
I would appreciate a couple of sentences about your thought process
and what makes your plot particularly bad.
You can strike terror into the reader's heart in multiple
ways. Here are some ideas, mix and match what suits you:

- Make it really ugly by experimenting with different theme options.
- Make it really misleading by defying viewer expectations
  and breaking all norms. You are an artist now,
  norms don't apply to your art.
- Try out different geoms and combinations of aesthetics,
  maybe find the ones that are the worst possible choice
  for the features.

## Take a Sad Plot and Make it Better

The title of this exercise is stolen from
[this talk](https://alison.rbind.io/talk/2018-ohsu-sad-plot-better/)
by Alison Hill.

Now use what you learned to make a great plot!
Pick some features that you are interested in
and visualize them as informative and beautiful
as possible, while still staying honest to the data.
Maybe you are interested in changes over time,
maybe you find your favorite artist and want to situate
them in the context of other works.
Maybe you want to explore how different features relate
to each other or even want to attempt to
recreate the PCA to see, if you can find clusters
of genres. It is your call.

I am curious to see, what you come up with!

## Stats Time

There is no exercise on statistics here, but please think about
the topics of today's lecture and note down questions
that come up, so we can talk about them on Friday.
