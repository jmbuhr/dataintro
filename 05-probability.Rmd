## Motivation

## Statistically Significant...

## Getting our Hands dirty with Probability

### Definitions: Hypothesis

### Testing the Null Hypothesis with a Simulation

### Getting precise with the Binomial Distribution

### But how much better? Understanding Effect Size and Power, False Positives and False Negatives

## P-Value Pitfalls

### Multiple Testing Correction

### Other forms of p-hacking

## Bayesian Statistics and the Base Rate Fallacy

## Concepts discussed today

## Exercises

### Discovering a new Distribution
